        <h2>LSM400 Linear Smith Machine</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and
                the LSM400 leads the field. Designed for both serious
                fitness users and beginners, the LSM400's vertical design
                provides all of the safety and control associated with Smith
                Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of
                gravity for effective resistance. You don't even need a
                workout partner. Lock points can be set to prevent the bar
                from movement outside of your body's natural range of
                motion.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smooth Smith Action:</strong> The bar (rated at
                    800 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings alongside
                    solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to
                    successful workouts, as the target muscles are utilized
                    to their full potential with each repetition.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Angle:</strong> The bar travels along a 7
                    degree path from vertical. Studies have shown that this
                    is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
                    prevent injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> The LSM400 has 20 lock-out
                    points for a safe, solid stop at any point in your
                    workout routine.</li>
                <li><strong>Rugged:</strong> Constructed with heavy 12 gauge
                    steel and 7 gauge reinforcing plate. This is a unit
                    built to last.</li>
                <li><strong>Warranty:</strong> Every part of the LSM400 has
                    a lifetime guarantee. We will replace or repair anything
                    that goes wrong.</li>
